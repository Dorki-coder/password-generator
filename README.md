## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJS

### Continued development

I would like to spend more time on planning with designs before starting to code. In this project I spent a lot of time on planning, but I still feel it wasn't enough.
While coding I had to change my mind a few times, so spending more time on planning would have saved me some time.
I would like to work on naming classes and files too. I think I don't spend enough time on thinking about names.
